**Stages to complete before proceeding to additional functionality.**

  ##Stage 1:

  - Redesign Chat component to have Create/Join rooms and save the rooms that have been joined already.
  - After creating a room there will be a room id which the creator will need to give to their friends in order to join.

  ##Stage 2:
  
  - Connect app to firebase.
  - Once a subscribe-success comes back, check that db/channel for any chat history.
  - Anytime a message is sent and a res comes back, save that message to history.

  ##Stage 3:

  - Implement the actual features of the game (whatever they might be)
